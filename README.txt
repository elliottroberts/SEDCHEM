A reaction-transport model of marine sediment biogeochemistry
#
The SEDCHEM code comprises a 1-D reaction-transport model of marine sediment diagenesis, including the biogeochemical recycling of C, N, P, S, Fe, and Mn. The model currently includes 15 dissolved species and 21 solid-phase spscies.  All model equations and parameters are described in detail in the Supplementary Information to M. Zhao, S. Zhang, L.G. Tarhan, C.T. Reinhard and N. Planavsky [2020] "The role of calcium in regulating marine phosphorus burial and atmospheric oxygenation", Nature Communications, doi:10.1038/s41467-020-15673-3.
